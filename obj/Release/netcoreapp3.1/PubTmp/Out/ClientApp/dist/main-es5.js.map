example:\n *\n * ```ts\n * $localize `some string to localize`\n * ```\n *\n * **Providing meaning, description and id**\n *\n * You can optionally specify one or more of `meaning`, `description` and `id` for a localized\n * string by pre-pending it with a colon delimited block of the form:\n *\n * ```ts\n * $localize`:meaning|description@@id:source message text`;\n *\n * $localize`:meaning|:source message text`;\n * $localize`:description:source message text`;\n * $localize`:@@id:source message text`;\n * ```\n *\n * This format is the same as that used for `i18n` markers in Angular templates. See the\n * [Angular 18n guide](guide/i18n#template-translations).\n *\n * **Naming placeholders**\n *\n * If the template literal string contains expressions, then the expressions will be automatically\n * associated with placeholder names for you.\n *\n * For example:\n *\n * ```ts\n * $localize `Hi ${name}! There are ${items.length} items.`;\n * ```\n *\n * will generate a message-source of `Hi {$PH}! There are {$PH_1} items`.\n *\n * The recommended practice is to name the placeholder associated with each expression though.\n *\n * Do this by providing the placeholder name wrapped in `:` characters directly after the\n * expression. These placeholder names are stripped out of the rendered localized string.\n *\n * For example, to name the `items.length` expression placeholder `itemCount` you write:\n *\n * ```ts\n * $localize `There are ${items.length}:itemCount: items`;\n * ```\n *\n * **Escaping colon markers**\n *\n * If you need to use a `:` character directly at the start of a tagged string that has no\n * metadata block, or directly after a substitution expression that has no name you must escape\n * the `:` by preceding it with a backslash:\n *\n * For example:\n *\n * ```ts\n * // message has a metadata block so no need to escape colon\n * $localize `:some description::this message starts with a colon (:)`;\n * // no metadata block so the colon must be escaped\n * $localize `\\:this message starts with a colon (:)`;\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * // named substitution so no need to escape colon\n * $localize `${label}:label:: ${}`\n * // anonymous substitution so colon must be escaped\n * $localize `${label}\\: ${}`\n * ```\n *\n * **Processing localized strings:**\n *\n * There are three scenarios:\n *\n * * **compile-time inlining**: the `$localize` tag is transformed at compile time by a\n * transpiler, removing the tag and replacing the template literal string with a translated\n * literal string from a collection of translations provided to the transpilation tool.\n *\n * * **run-time evaluation**: the `$localize` tag is a run-time function that replaces and\n * reorders the parts (static strings and expressions) of the template literal string with strings\n * from a collection of translations loaded at run-time.\n *\n * * **pass-through evaluation**: the `$localize` tag is a run-time function that simply evaluates\n * the original template literal string without applying any translations to the parts. This\n * version is used during development or where there is no need to translate the localized\n * template literals.\n * @param messageParts a collection of the static parts of the template string.\n * @param expressions a collection of the values of each placeholder in the template string.\n * @returns the translated string, with the `messageParts` and `expressions` interleaved together.\n */\nconst $localize = function (messageParts, ...expressions) {\n    if ($localize.translate) {\n        // Don't use array expansion here to avoid the compiler adding `__read()` helper unnecessarily.\n        const translation = $localize.translate(messageParts, expressions);\n        messageParts = translation[0];\n        expressions = translation[1];\n    }\n    let message = stripBlock(messageParts[0], messageParts.raw[0]);\n    for (let i = 1; i < messageParts.length; i++) {\n        message += expressions[i - 1] + stripBlock(messageParts[i], messageParts.raw[i]);\n    }\n    return message;\n};\nconst BLOCK_MARKER = ':';\n/**\n * Strip a delimited \"block\" from the start of the `messagePart`, if it is found.\n *\n * If a marker character (:) actually appears in the content at the start of a tagged string or\n * after a substitution expression, where a block has not been provided the character must be\n * escaped with a backslash, `\\:`.
